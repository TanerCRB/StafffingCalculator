# Ninefold — instantiated for StafffingCalculator

This repository is both the Ninefold process kit *and* the product it now governs: an IT project
staffing/profitability planner (`backend/` Python/FastAPI, `frontend/` React/TypeScript;
requirements in [`Wymagania/Requirements_EN.md`](Wymagania/Requirements_EN.md)). Start here:
[`TEAM-CONTRACT.md`](TEAM-CONTRACT.md) (who does what), [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) (the task
register — `SC-1-01` is the first task waiting to run through the process), `backend/README.md`,
`frontend/README.md`.

The rest of this file, `FrameworkDoc.md`, and `process/` describe the **general, portable Ninefold
pattern** this project's configuration (`agents/`, `TEAM-CONTRACT.md`, `process/labels.json`,
`process/issue-templates/`) was adapted from — kept as reference for the reasoning behind each
adapted file.

## About the kit

*A starter kit for an AI-agent SDLC process.*

**Why "Ninefold":** the process is carried by nine actors — eight specialized agent roles
(Product Owner, Analyst, Architect, Developer, QA, Invariant Guardian, Reviewer, Security
Auditor) plus the human — and that number is not incidental. It's the structural core the whole
kit is built around: a role that produces something never evaluates it, and every handoff between
roles puts a fresh set of eyes on the result (see `FrameworkDoc.md`, section 3).

An anonymized, portable excerpt from a real SDLC process based on Spec-Driven Development
and Human-in-the-Loop, described in [`FrameworkDoc.md`](FrameworkDoc.md). This directory contains
**working artifacts**, not just a description: agent role definitions, Issue/PR templates, a label
manifest, sync scripts, a pre-push hook, and a guide to reconstructing the whole thing on a new
repository.

All project names, organization, business domain, and specific identifiers (ADR numbers, Issue,
PR, hosts, accounts) have been removed or replaced with placeholders in angle brackets,
e.g. `<repo-backend>`, `<owner>`, `<Entity>`. Substitute the specifics of your own project for them.

## How to read this directory

1. **[`FrameworkDoc.md`](FrameworkDoc.md)** — the philosophy and mechanics of the process: nine
   roles, three human gates, mutation testing as the core of proof, state management, parallel
   work by multiple agents, cost in tokens. Start here to understand **why** the rest of the
   directory looks the way it looks.
2. **[`TEAM-CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md`](TEAM-CONTRACT-TEMPLATE.md)** — the team contract: who does what,
   which tools they don't have, where the boundary lies that can't be expressed in the permission
   declaration itself, how to launch a role. This is the document the role definitions defer to in
   case of discrepancy.
3. **[`agents/`](agents/)** — eight role templates to adapt (Product Owner, Analyst, Architect,
   Developer, QA, Invariant Guardian, Reviewer, Security Auditor). The evaluating roles
   (`invariant-guardian.md`, `reviewer.md`, `security-auditor.md`) have checklists marked as
   EXAMPLE — write your own, concrete rules. `developer.md` combines the backend/frontend variants
   in a single file with two example checklists side by side; if you have two technology stacks,
   split it into two files (see the note at the top of the file).
4. **[`process/`](process/)** — the state machine, label manifest, Issue and PR templates, the
   pre-push hook, the `main` protection variant without a paid plan, repository settings, release
   versioning, the cross-repository gap channel.
   **[`task-command.md`](process/task-command.md)** and
   **[`task-status-command.md`](process/task-status-command.md)** — the full content of the
   command that drives one task through the whole lifecycle (the equivalent of
   `/zadanie_be`/`/zadanie_fe`) and its read-only sibling (`/zadanie_stan`) — they belong in the
   product repository, not here (see `FrameworkDoc.md`, section 4).
5. **[`tools/`](tools/)** — `sync-agents.mjs` (copies role definitions from the process repository
   to the `.claude/agents/` of the product repository) and `sync-github.mjs` (distributes Issue/PR
   templates and prints `gh` commands for labels).
6. **[`calibration/`](calibration/)** — how to check that an evaluating role actually evaluates,
   before you start trusting it.
7. **[`process/bootstrap-guide.md`](process/bootstrap-guide.md)** — a step-by-step sequence of
   actions to go from an empty repository to a working pipeline with gates. Start here if you want
   to **act**, not just understand.

## Minimal set to get started

If you don't have time to read everything: `FrameworkDoc.md` §1–5, one role from `agents/` as a
sample (e.g. `invariant-guardian.md` — it has the most mechanical output format),
`process/sdlc-flow.md`, and `process/bootstrap-guide.md` steps 0–4.

## What this kit deliberately does not contain

- **Specific domain checklists.** The Guardian's rules, the Analyst's criteria, the invariants in
  the PR template — all of this has to be written from scratch for your domain and your stack.
  FrameworkDoc.md §12 states this explicitly: *roles and gates are universal, checklists are not*.
- **CI configuration for a specific runner provider.** `process/ci-and-branch-protection.md` and
  `process/repository-settings.md` describe patterns (path filter versus required check, runner
  watchdog, `runs-on` as an expression) — not ready-made workflow files.
- **A persistent orchestrator.** FrameworkDoc.md §3 describes the entry condition under which it's
  even worth building one. This kit assumes you haven't reached it yet.
