"""The only path by which project rows enter the database (SC-1-01).

The counterpart to `app.data.project_reads`. ADR-0001 (addendum 2026-09-18, variant B) makes one
shared function the single *read* path so the `project_access` filter cannot be forgotten; the
same reasoning applies on the way in — creating a project and granting its creator access are one
unit of work. Split across two call sites they eventually drift apart, and a project nobody can
see is indistinguishable from a project that was never written (see `project_for_caller`).

Scope of this module: create only. Editing, archiving and copying are SC-1-02..04 and are
deliberately absent — including any "update if it already exists" convenience.

    Two things this function deliberately does not take as arguments:

      resolved per request from the request's own auth context (`app.api.deps`), so a client
      cannot name the beneficiary of the grant by putting a user id in the request body.
    - **`status`.** A new project is Active by the column default; setting it here would be the
      archive action, which belongs to SC-1-03/04.

    `owner` is F-01's business owner of the project — a free-text field shown to people, not an
    access grant. Access is the `project_access` row below; conflating the two would make a
    typo in a name an authorization decision.

    The commit is here rather than in the endpoint: "the project is persisted" is this module's
