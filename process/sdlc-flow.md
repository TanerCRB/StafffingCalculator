# SDLC flow and state machine

> Template for adaptation. Scope: one product repository (`<repo-backend>` or
> `<repo-frontend>`). Stories and pull requests live in the product repository — `Closes #12`
> closes an Issue only within the same repository, and the syntax `Closes owner/repo#12` only
> creates a link and **does not close** the Issue after merging. The process source repository is
> the source of truth for the label manifest and templates, not a place of work.

## States

Exactly **one** `state:*` label per Issue. The `role:*` label says who is holding the ball.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> analysis
    analysis --> design : acceptance criteria ready
    design --> decision : impact map ready
    decision --> implementation : 🔒 approved
    decision --> analysis : 🔒 rejected, scope needs rethinking
    implementation --> qa : PR open, full test suite green
    qa --> implementation : negative test found a defect
    qa --> merge : mutation executed, Invariant Guardian PASS
    merge --> implementation : 🔒 PR feedback
    merge --> closed : 🔒 merged, status raised
    closed --> [*]
```

🔒 = a transition that only a human performs.

| State | Who works | Exit from this state |
|---|---|---|
| `state:analysis` | Product Owner, Analyst | *Definition of Done* and *Out of scope* filled in |
| `state:design` | Architect | Impact map; on deviation — ADR deviation label |
| `state:decision` 🔒 | **You** | Scope and architecture approved |
| `state:implementation` | Developer | PR open, full test suite green |
| `state:qa` | QA, Invariant Guardian | Contrast test, mutation recorded, audit verdict |
| `state:merge` 🔒 | **You** | PR merged |
| `state:closed` | — | Status raised in the register |

## One filter that's enough

```
is:open label:waiting-on-human
```

The `waiting-on-human` label accompanies every gate state. Thanks to it you don't need to
remember which states are gates — one filter shows everything that is standing and waiting for
you. An agent that enters a gate state **applies this label and stops working**.

## Rules we don't break

**An agent does not remove the `waiting-on-human` label.** Removing it is equivalent to making a
decision. You remove it, by moving on to the next state.

**An agent does not pass through a gate on its own**, even when the answer seems obvious. A gate
through which an agent sometimes passes on its own stops being a gate.

**The ADR deviation label stops work regardless of state.** It is removed only by an accepted
decision or by an explicitly recorded deviation with a date and justification.

**The `evidence:missing` label blocks the transition to `state:closed`.** Code that exists but
has no passing test does not check off the task — this is not a formality, it is the only reason
the progress register can be trusted.

## What this machine does not cover

Process tasks of the AI team itself (e.g. `PROC-1-xx`) **have no Issue**. They live in the
process rollout plan with *Definition of Done* rows, and progress in the run log. For a handful
of such tasks, a separate tracker would be a tool without work to do.
