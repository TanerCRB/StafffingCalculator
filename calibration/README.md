An evaluating role (Invariant Guardian, Reviewer, QA, and any other role whose sole output is a
verdict on someone else's work) is verified the same way a test is verified by mutation: it is run
on material with a **known, predetermined outcome**, and you measure whether it actually detects
what it's supposed to detect, and doesn't report what isn't there.

Two situations call for two different calibration methods — depending on whether the role checks
against a **closed list of rules**, or looks for flaws **that no list knows about**.

## Method 1 — a role with a closed list of rules (e.g. the Invariant Guardian)

Seeded set: files with deliberately introduced violations, mixed in with **decoys** — fragments
that look like a violation but aren't — plus one run on real, clean, approved code as a control
against false alarms.

It answers two questions that a single run can't settle:

1. **Sensitivity** — does the role detect violations we know are there?
2. **False alarms** — does it stay silent on code we know is correct?

An agent that reports problems everywhere is just as useless as one that reports them nowhere.
Without both runs, there's no way to know which side it falls on.

Set structure:

| Element | Role |
|---|---|
| `seeded/` | A handful of files posing as new work submitted for review, containing a seeded set of violations of varying severity |
| `answer-key.md` | The answer key: exactly what was seeded, which rule, the expected severity, and the decoys — things that look like violations but aren't |

The run on clean code uses real, approved files from the product repository — no copy of them is
kept in the calibration set, because a copy drifts from the original within weeks. The current
files are taken straight from the repository.

**How to run it:**

- **Run A — false alarms.** The role gets a real, approved fragment of product code. Expected
  result: `PASS`, zero findings.
- **Run B — sensitivity.** The role gets the files from `seeded/` as "new work submitted for
  review", with the rest of the repository as reference material. Expected result: `STOP`
  and the full set of items from `answer-key.md`.
- **Do not show the agent `answer-key.md`.**

See `example-answer-key.md` in this directory — a skeleton answer key with example items in a
neutral domain, to be replaced with your project's real rules.

**Limitation of this method:** seeded violations are explicit — each one can be pointed to in a
single file. Real violations are often distributed (a mechanism correct in one place, bypassed in
another). This set proves that the role knows the rules and doesn't panic. **It does not prove**
that it will catch a violation spread across multiple files. Extending the set with such cases is
a natural next step.

## Method 2 — a role without a closed list of rules (e.g. the Reviewer)

A role without a checklist has nothing to seed — a seeded violation is by definition a violation
of a *rule*, and this type of role looks for flaws that no rule knows about. The answer key here
is a **review performed earlier by a human** on a historical code change, with the tree restored to
its state **before the fixes**.

**How to reconstruct the code state:** pick a commit for which a documented human review from
before the fixes exists. Reconstruct the tree without touching the source repository:

```bash
mkdir -p <working-directory>/cal-reviewer-<sha>
git archive <sha> | tar -x -C <working-directory>/cal-reviewer-<sha>
```

`git archive` only reads the repository. Check that the review document had not yet entered the
tree at that commit (it must have been added AFTER the reviewed commit) — otherwise the agent
might stumble onto the answers.

**How to run it:** the agent gets only the path to the unpacked tree and is forbidden from leaving
it. The review scope is given using the same sentence the human used. **Do not show the agent the
human review document, or its location.**

If the code lives outside the directory the agent's tools see directly (e.g. on another machine),
the agent must read it through a channel that actually reads from there — not one assumed
upfront. This isn't a technical detail: a copying tool that silently returns a stale version and
reports success is a real, documented failure mode (see `../FrameworkDoc.md`, section 9, "Failure
pattern: a tool reports success while being wrong").

**How to score the run** — three numbers, not one:

| Measure | How |
|---|---|
| **Sensitivity** | how many of the human's findings the role found |
| **Precision** | how many of its findings hold up under verification — each checked individually against the code, not taken on faith |
| **Surplus** | how many true findings it found that aren't in the human's review |

Surplus matters because the answer key **is not complete** — a human review is one pass by one
person, not an exhaustive list of flaws. A finding outside the answer key is not a false alarm
until it's been refuted — each one has to be refuted individually.

**Trap to watch for: a set contaminated by the role's own definition.** If the role's definition
quotes specific findings from the answer key (e.g. as examples in a "why you exist" section), the
run no longer measures sensitivity for those items — at best it measures whether the agent can find
in the code something it was told is there. Only count items that the role's definition doesn't
quote. Once questions targeting specific, previously omitted findings are added to the role's
definition, those findings also stop measuring sensitivity from that point on — a repeat run on the
same answer key is then worth only as much as a regression check (whether the definition change
broke what used to work), not a fresh sensitivity measurement. The next sensitivity measurement
needs a **different** answer key.

## Method 3 — calibrating deterministic tools (not roles)

The same mechanism — check it against material with a known outcome before you start trusting it —
also applies to your own hand-written validators and gates (convention checkers, documentation
completeness checks, module-boundary scanners, anything you run in CI), not only to AI-evaluated
roles. A deterministic tool is cheaper to calibrate than a role — you don't need a separate run or
a human comparison, because the code itself can carry its own control cases.

Pattern: every such tool gets a self-test mode (e.g. a `--self-test` flag) that runs its **own,
built-in** contrast cases — a file that should pass, and a file that should fail — and **must pass
before the tool runs the real check** against actual code. This is the same effect as mutating a
test, just executed automatically on every run instead of only when the role definition changes —
because the cost is close to zero, there's no reason to do it less often.

Without this, a validator that has stopped checking anything (a broken condition, a typo in a
regex, a changed path) keeps returning success — the exact same failure mode as "a tool returns
success while being wrong" from `../FrameworkDoc.md`, section 9, just in a helper tool instead of
an AI role.

## When to repeat it

After every change to the role's definition. A role that stops detecting an item from the answer
key, or starts reporting a decoy, is a regression — just like a failing test. For deterministic
tools (Method 3), the equivalent is a change to the self-test's control case — it happens less
often, but the rule is the same.

## Two general takeaways from calibration in practice

1. **A false "checked and clean" is more expensive than an oversight.** An entry in the "checked
   and clean" section must carry exactly as much evidence as a reported problem — merely stating
   "looks fine" is not enough. Observed failure mode: the agent takes the author's intent, as
   stated in a code comment, for an agreed decision, instead of comparing it against the register
   of decisions actually adopted, and marks the area clean on that basis.
2. **A calibration set can be contaminated by the role's own definition.** If the examples used in
   the role's description overlap with items in the test set, sensitivity comes out artificially
   inflated. Build calibration sets independently of the examples in the role's definition, not
   from them.
